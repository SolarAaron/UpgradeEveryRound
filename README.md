# UpgradeEveryRound
Simple mod meant for larger groups that ensures everybody gets at least one upgrade per round.
Players are prompted to choose which upgrade they want upon loading into the shop level.
Hosts config is used in multiplayer.

## Config
### Upgrades Per Round
Pretty self explanatory, this is the number of upgrades that each player gets every round
### Limited Random Choices
This a toggle which if set to true will make it so that each player has to choose from a randomly selected list of upgrades instead of being able to choose any upgrade
### Number of Choices
How many choices the player has available to choose from if Limited Random Choices is enabled

## Upgrade Toggles
You can also toggle each type of upgrade in the config.
